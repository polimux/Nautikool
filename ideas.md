# Nautikool Ideas, Product Backlog and Working Log

## Product thesis

Nautikool is a local-first sailing companion for coastal skippers. It should combine learning, vessel-specific preparation, passage planning, safety checklists and eventually live onboard context from navigation electronics.

The intended first user is a competent but still learning skipper sailing a 9-11 m yacht in the Baltic Sea, often with limited crew or singlehanded. The product should feel like a calm co-skipper: practical, conservative, offline-capable and transparent about assumptions.

Working positioning:

> Duolingo meets Navionics meets a smart skipper notebook.

Nautikool should help answer four cockpit-relevant questions:

1. What do I need to know?
2. What do I need to prepare?
3. What is happening around my boat?
4. What should I do next?

## Product principles

### Project manager view

- Ship small, coherent increments.
- Keep the repository understandable at every stage.
- Document decisions before implementation becomes random.
- Prefer workflows that reduce skipper workload and risk.
- Avoid feature bloat until the local-first core is useful.

### Developer view

- Keep content, vessel data, passage planning, checklists and integrations separable.
- Prefer local-first storage and offline operation.
- Treat hardware integrations as optional adapters, not as the product foundation.
- Put tests around calculations, parsers, state transitions and safety logic.

### Tester view

- Test realistic sailing scenarios, not only happy paths.
- Include failure modes: no internet, stale weather, wrong units, missing GPS, AIS noise, low battery and tired crew.
- Safety guidance must be conservative and assumption-driven.
- The app must not imply certainty when it only has incomplete information.

### User view

- The app must be useful with wet hands, glare, fatigue and limited attention.
- It must work without internet during a passage.
- It should expose reasoning quickly: why green, why yellow, why red.
- It should support pre-departure preparation as much as underway use.

### Product manager view

- The wedge is a practical skipper preparation and onboard reference tool.
- The moat is the combination of structured learning, vessel-specific data, route context and safety workflows.
- The first wow moment should be: "This understands my boat, my route and my current skill level."

## Current repository assessment

Date: 2026-07-09

Repository state reviewed:

- Repository exists and is writable.
- `ideas.md` remains the product source of truth.
- `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/domain-model.md` exist.
- A runnable SvelteKit/TypeScript skeleton exists.
- Pure checklist domain types and state-transition logic exist under `src/lib/domain`.
- Checklist run summaries expose progress, completion eligibility, required open items and blocker messages.
- Vitest tests cover checklist state semantics, blocker/progress semantics and starter checklist content.
- GitHub Actions CI validates install, Svelte/TypeScript checks, unit tests and production build.
- The starter content registry includes departure readiness, diesel inboard pre-start, night-arrival, heavy-weather departure and MOB immediate-action checklist templates.
- The Passage Planner slice has typed passage plan domain types, pure summary logic, tests and one realistic Turku to Pärnu H-323 sample route.
- The Vessel Profile slice has richer equipment, engine, rig, battery, tank and readiness-finding types.
- A first H-323 Elina vessel profile exists with identity data, Yanmar engine checks, Raymarine/Orca/em-trak equipment, safety equipment and explicit assumptions about unverified capacities.
- The Risk Engine slice has typed weather, crew, vessel, passage and traffic-light risk assessment structures.
- A first static Turku to Pärnu H-323 family risk scenario exists and is surfaced on the landing page.
- Risk Engine v1 also models likely night/overnight legs and restricted visibility as explicit decision inputs.
- A second static risk scenario demonstrates the Hanko to Haapsalu night-crossing decision problem with limited visibility and no recorded night experience.
- The NMEA/AIS slice now has a typed network readiness model, skipper-facing PGN explanations, an H-323 Elina network profile and tests.
- The NMEA/AIS slice now also has static AIS traffic snapshot logic, a Hanko approach training scenario, prioritised watch actions and compact watch briefs.
- A third fog-bank AIS drill now demonstrates restricted-visibility cockpit handover with immediate, soon and stale-target priorities.
- The landing page surfaces checklist, passage, vessel, risk, NMEA/AIS readiness and AIS traffic watch-brief content slices.
- The repository currently has `package.json` but no committed npm lockfile.

Decision:

- Continue the 80% implementation / 20% documentation shift.
- Extend the NMEA/AIS Adapter from action queues into a watch-brief layer that can be read aloud by tired crew.
- Keep the implementation pure and deterministic: static AIS target snapshots in, summary/actions/briefing lines out.
- Add a restricted-visibility fog-bank scenario because the next high-value training case is not more targets, but a compact handover under degraded attention and visibility.
- Keep safety language conservative: the watch brief must explicitly state that AIS is a prompt, not proof of right-of-way, safe clearance or live traffic advice.

Rationale:

- The previous AIS slice answered "what should I do next?" but the UI still exposed actions as a list, not as a cockpit handover.
- A watch brief is the bridge from domain logic toward cockpit mode, watch handover, printable emergency/passage cards and scenario training.
- Restricted visibility is a known risk amplifier in the existing Risk Engine, so AIS content should teach the same conservative mental model.
- The fog-bank drill adds new user-facing Baltic content while staying offline, deterministic and testable.

Working log:

- Added `AisWatchBrief` domain types with headline, immediate/soon/monitor action groups, handover lines and safety limitations.
- Added `buildAisWatchBrief` to convert AIS scenarios into compact skipper-facing cockpit handovers.
- Added a typed H-323 Elina fog-bank AIS watch brief drill with a close commercial target, close fast small craft and stale harbour symbol.
- Added Vitest coverage for watch brief construction, restricted-visibility content and the watch-brief drill registry.
- Updated the landing page to surface AIS watch briefs and handover lines instead of only action lists.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with the AIS watch brief logic, content, tests and UI change.

## Expected bug classes and prevention

| ID | Area | Risk | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| B-001 | Unit conversion | Confusion between m, nm, kn, km/h and hours. | Central unit library and tests. |
| B-002 | Time zones | ETA and weather timestamps mismatch. | Store timezone metadata; test Baltic crossings. |
| B-003 | Offline data | Missing route/checklist content once network is gone. | Offline manifest and offline integration tests. |
| B-004 | AIS parsing | Wrong target sorting or stale targets shown as current. | Timestamp validation and simulator tests. |
| B-005 | Weather freshness | Old forecast displayed as current. | Expiry rules and prominent freshness banner. |
| B-006 | Safety language | Overconfident or unsafe recommendation wording. | Conservative copy, assumptions and red/yellow escalation. |
| B-007 | Vessel-specific data | Generic checklist ignores the actual boat setup. | Vessel profile linked to checklist generation. |
| B-008 | Checklist state | Skipped required items appear as safe completion. | Checklist completion logic distinguishes clean completion from warned completion. |
| B-009 | Missing data | Unknown weather, route or crew data defaults to green. | Model `unknown` separately and test conservative escalation. |
| B-010 | Domain/UI coupling | UI state becomes the source of truth. | Keep checklist logic as pure TypeScript functions with tests. |
| B-011 | Broken main branch | New features compile locally but break tests or build. | GitHub Actions validates checks, tests and build on push/PR. |
| B-012 | CI dependency setup | CI fails before product checks because dependency caching assumes a missing lockfile. | Avoid npm cache until a lockfile exists; then use lockfile-backed installs. |
| B-013 | Repository drift | Changes are made without a clear decision record, validation path or safety-sensitive review shape. | Use `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the `ideas.md` decision/working-log format for meaningful changes. |
| B-014 | Passage distance optimism | A nominal day plan hides that one leg is too long for family crew or daylight. | Keep leg-level distances and summary tests visible; later add thresholds and warnings. |
| B-015 | False checklist readiness | A checklist with required open items looks nearly complete and encourages departure. | Expose required-open blockers, completion eligibility and progress separately. |
| B-016 | Vessel false precision | Unknown tank or battery capacities are guessed and then reused in range or risk logic. | Store unknown capacities explicitly and test that unverified values remain undefined. |
| B-017 | Equipment string coupling | Features depend on UI text instead of stable equipment identifiers. | Use stable equipment IDs and tests for key navigation, communication and safety items. |
| B-018 | False green risk | Missing or stale weather, fatigue or equipment gaps are accidentally treated as acceptable. | Risk rules escalate missing and stale inputs to yellow/red with tests. |
| B-019 | Static scenario mistaken for live advice | Demo risk content is interpreted as current weather guidance. | Label static risk scenarios as planning examples and require explicit forecast timestamps. |
| B-020 | Night-risk blind spot | A passage can include likely night hours while crew night experience is ignored. | Treat non-daylight legs and unknown/missing night experience as explicit risk findings. |
| B-021 | Visibility blind spot | Fog or poor visibility is buried in weather text and does not affect departure advice. | Model visibility in nautical miles and escalate limited/restricted visibility with tests. |
| B-022 | Network false confidence | A plotter shows some data, but GNSS source, AIS target path, DSC position or backbone health is unknown. | Model network devices, PGNs, power injection and terminators explicitly with warnings/blockers. |
| B-023 | AIS false confidence | A stale target, missing CPA/TCPA or close fast ferry is displayed without urgency or context. | Summarize AIS target age, CPA/TCPA and Class A proximity with conservative findings and tests. |
| B-024 | AIS action overload | Too many simultaneous AIS notes bury the urgent ferry or close-quarters decision. | Generate prioritised watch actions and test that immediate close-CPA actions sort before monitor notes. |
| B-025 | Watch handover overload | A useful action list is still too verbose to read aloud in rain, fog or fatigue. | Build compact watch briefs with grouped actions, short handover lines and explicit limitations. |
